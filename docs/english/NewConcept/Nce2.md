## Course 12

Goodbye and good luck

Where is Captain Alison going and how

Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison will sail from PortsMouth tomorrow

We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning

He will be in his small boat, Topsail

Topsail is a famous little boat

It has sailed across the Atlantic many times

Captain Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time

We'll see his boat and then we'll say goodbye to him

He will be away for thwo months

We are very proud of him

He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic
