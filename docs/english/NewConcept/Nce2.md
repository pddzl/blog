## Course 13

Do you speak english

Did the young man speak english

I had an amusing experience last year

After i had left a small village in the south of France

I drove on to the next town

On the way a young man waved to me

I stopped and he asked me for a lift

As soon as he had got into the car, i said good morning to him in Frence and he replied in the same language

Apart from a few words i do not know any Frence at all

Neither of us spoke during the journey

I had nearly reached the town

When the young man suddenly said to me very slowly do you speak english

As i soon learnt he was english himself
